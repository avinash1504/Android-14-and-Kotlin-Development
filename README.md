## RockPaperScissors
-> First project in this repo where I tried to do some basic operations using loops and comparisions and programmed Rock Paper Scissors  
->Input of the user will be taken everytime someone tries to run the code and it will be compared with the computer's choice  
->If we enter incorrect string then it will throw an error and informs to select appropriate option
